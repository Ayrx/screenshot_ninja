# Screenshot Ninja

Screenshot Ninja makes it easy to capture screenshots from inside Binary
Ninja. Even better, Screenshot Ninja allows you to capture screenshots at
higher-than-native resolution, which will look great on high DPI displays. By
default, Screenshot Ninja provides actions for 1x and 2x resolution screenshots,
but you can use a custom scaling factore set as high as you dare to go.
