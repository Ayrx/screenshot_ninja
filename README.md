# Screenshot Ninja

Screenshot Ninja makes it easy to capture screenshots of Binary Ninja!

## Features

Screenshot Ninja currently allows you to capture screenshots:

- of the active linear/graph view;
- of the entire Binary Ninja window; and
- at custom scaling factors, such as 2x or 3x the native resolution.

## Install

Screenshot Ninja is not yet in the official plugin repository, so for now clone
this repository or download a release and place it in your user plugins folder.

## Usage

Use the context menu or command palette to find Screenshot Ninja's commands. The
"save view image" command family will save an image of the active linear/graph
view, while the "save window image" command family will save an image of the
entire Binary Ninja window.
